The results of these analyses suggest that higher rates of depression to adulthood amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances and less psychosocial capital of the comorbid group.

Answer:Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma may indeed be a significant factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophils play a crucial role in the inflammatory response to trauma, and their excessive migration and activity in the lungs can contribute to the development of ARDS. This heightened migratory activity may lead to increased release of inflammatory mediators and tissue damage, ultimately worsening pulmonary function and potentially leading to a clinical diagnosis of ARDS. Further research is needed to fully understand", "Question: Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: Can this be a significant factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?
