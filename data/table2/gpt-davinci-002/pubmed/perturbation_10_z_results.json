Answer: Emergency laparotomy is associated with a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "Question: 30-Day post-operative mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement? Answer: Emergency laparotomy is associated with a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this demographic group. This could involve increasing acute care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services in specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery . What is the main area of concern and need for improvement? Emergency surgical surgery, particularly laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in patients over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients who may benefit from elective surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with appropriate expertise involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery patients. Is there an area of concern and need for improvement? Open laparotomy remains associated with a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients, or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and critical care doctors, and education of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery patients have been an area of concern and need for improvement for some time. Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even relocation of emergency surgical services to primary care centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery: is this an area of concern and need for improvement? Answer: Emergency general surgery still carries a high rate of mortality, particularly in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. Improvements may involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early identification of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for emergency patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons , the inclusion of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.", "Question: 30-Day postoperative mortality in emergency surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement? Answer: Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group.

However, the incidence of complications was the same between both groups.", "Question: Is the time it takes to perform transurethral resection of the prostate influenced by the surgeon's previous experience? Answer: The senior urologist was superior at resecting the prostate, removing approximately 30% more tissue per time unit than the more inexperienced surgeons. Therefore, a surgeon's experience may be important to reduce the risk of secondary TURP due to recurring adenomas or adenomas that were incompletely resected. However, the incidence of complications was similar between the two surgical groups.", "Question: Is the ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate influenced by the surgeon's previous experience? Answer: The senior urologist was capable of resecting up to 56% more tissue with the perineal unit than the more inexperienced surgeons.

However, the incidence of complications was the same between the three groups.", "Question: Is the ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate influenced by the surgeon's previous experience?

Answer: These data indicate that major blunt trauma rapidly increases the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be due to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 appears to be central to the establishment of the neutrophil depletion state that is characteristic of ARDS."], "original_ll": -2.3975155835722624, "sampled_ll": -1.7777113605300003, "all_perturbed_sampled_ll": [-2.102051859853143, -2.3386386938023116, -1.8747536010158288, -1.8742329251647727, -1.9060664769704092, -2.004011860606818, -2.0648118893358336, -2.0476770713535517, -2.0770156511188436, -1.815295506001676], "all_perturbed_original_ll": [-2.5124168959347823, -2.407021041131504, -2.3562290868192903, -2.510139485639051, -2.399035712968919, -2.338641117214084, -2.373013001096763, -2.460490609768088, -2.5333990828664663, -2.392727995571594], "perturbed_sampled_ll": -2.0104555535223185, "perturbed_original_ll": -2.4283114029010546, "perturbed_sampled_ll_std": 0.14521088979239813, "perturbed_original_ll_std": 0.06687267677428897}, {"original": "Question: A patient with myelomeningocele: is untethering necessary prior to scoliosis correction?
