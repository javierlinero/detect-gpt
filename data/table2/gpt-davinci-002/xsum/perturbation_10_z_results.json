The initiative has brought together Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the project's \u00a32 million grant has come from the European Union. The technology being developed could enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing materials for roof collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial site near Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last 20 years.
