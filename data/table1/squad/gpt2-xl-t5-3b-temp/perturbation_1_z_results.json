When a bird's bloodstream contains too much uric acid, its kidneys remove calcium or calcium carbonate from the bones, which is excreted in a similar manner as in the reptile's situation. The calcium deposits are smaller and smaller until the bird has reached a low enough calcium level that it can no longer absorb anything from its food, and dies. For birds to avoid this, they have to have calcium levels kept to the minimum recommended levels in their blood (10-10.5 mg"], "perturbed_original": ["Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid , urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or other urogenital opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. Birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete primarily creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as a soft waste output from the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it.

For example, menarche (the first menstrual period of a female) or semenarche (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or less restrictive stance toward teen or premarital sexual ity and sexual encounters. In general, the restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual relations, either in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to limit or prevent sexual activity between males and females throughout their development, or through public shaming and shame when sexual activity does occur.

By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month in the course of the previous 18 months. In a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4, 20% of 14\u221217-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the fall of their 9th year. A 2002 American study found that those aged 15\u201344 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females. The duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a romantic relationship with an older peer can be explained by sexual maturation and the development of cognitive skills necessary for a romantic relationship (eg, caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence.
