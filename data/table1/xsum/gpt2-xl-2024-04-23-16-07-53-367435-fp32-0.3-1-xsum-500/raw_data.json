Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr", "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack.

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and", "Regina Hungerford, 56, denied striking a 17-year-old as he listened to music in her class at Merthyr Tydfil College. But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand.

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London.

The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\"", "The launch of what was supposed to be its flagship model has turned into a fiasco for the world's largest smartphone maker.

At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said.

It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

They escaped back through the same hole. Police later found a burned-out vehicle close to the airport. Police are looking for eight men, a prosecutors' spokeswoman said. Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: \"What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum.\" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m). AFP quoted an unnamed spokeswoman at the same Antwerp centre calling the robbery \"one of the biggest\" ever. She said that the diamonds were \"rough stones\" being transported from Antwerp to Zurich.

Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named, Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman. Along with Louis Stevenson, its notable historical guests included Lord Carnarvon of Highclere Castle. It later became the Grand Hotel, and then the Lyndhurst Park Hotel.

It had hoped to increase the number of turbines between Kent and Essex to 341. The area is the winter home of about 6,500 red-throated divers - at least one third of the UK's population. London Array said it had formally requested The Crown Estate to terminate the agreement for lease for the phase two area and had cancelled the grid capacity that was reserved at the National Grid substation in Graveney, Kent. The wind farm, 10 miles north of Ramsgate, Kent, was given the green light in 2006 on condition that phase two, to add an extra 166 turbines, would only go ahead if the red-throated divers were protected.

Baroness Neville-Rolfe, minister for data protection, said the change will sent a \"clear message\" to rogue companies. \"Nuisance calls are incredibly intrusive and can cause significant harm to elderly and vulnerable members of society.\" The government was committed to tackling the problem, she said.

Last Monday, the government said it was willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks. The BMA also agreed to defer any new threats of strikes for five days. The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be \"clarity about the next steps by the end of the day\".

The IFA's Disciplinary Committee also imposed fines of \u00a3400 on each player, whose names have not been released. Prior to Wednesday night's hearing, all five players admitted to a breach of rules but claimed they had acted independently in placing bets.

Mr Buhari, 74, left for London nearly a month ago - his second trip to the UK for treatment this year. His absence has led to some anxiety in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, with people speculating about whether he will be able to resume his duties. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is acting president, and has been widely praised for his handling of the country's economic crisis, following a sharp fall in the price of oil, its major export.

Mr Malone said the problem appeared to be limited to Holy island, with users able to regain signal on the Anglesey mainland. He said more than 100 people had made complaints but no-one could get a firm answer on when the problem would be fixed.

The National Grid said the show would drive the biggest festive \"TV pickup\" - a sudden surge in electricity demand. The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period. But TV surges create less demand now than they did 20 years ago because more people use catch-up services to watch TV and do not all see a programme live.

The federation says the force has had to slash \u00a317m from its budget and there are \"at least\" \u00a310m in cuts \"to come\". Federation chairman Mike White said: \"In reality, 80% of our policing budget is down to staff and staff wages.

Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem. The report follows an unannounced inspection of the prison, near Hatfield Woodhouse, in February. It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons. More on this and other local stories in South Yorkshire Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: \"There are real opportunities at Moorland to make progress, but the issues of NPS... have such a negative impact on prisoners' experiences. \"In particular, there is a real opportunity to make progress in embracing the prison's new", "Last week, the High Court's rejected a bid by ministers to delay publication of the plan, which was prompted by high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This means the document should be published in the next week. Courts had given ministers until Monday 24 April to set out the draft guidelines. But on the Friday before the deadline, the government lodged an application to delay release until after the general election on 8 June. They argued that publication would fall foul of election \"purdah\" rules.

But what is it and why has it been taking the dance music world by storm? Surprisingly, the answer lies in the bus horns of Indonesia. Young people in Indonesia, amused by the local buses' customised horns, have been waiting by the side of the road for vehicles to pass, encouraging bus drivers to toot their horn when they did so. Videos depicting this craze have gone viral in Indonesia. Some held signs to better attract the attention of the driver - signs which said 'Om Telolet Om'. 'Telolet' is a word representing the sound of the buses' horns, while 'om' is a term for an older male, like 'uncle' or 'sir' in English. So 'Om Telolet Om' roughly translates as 'Sir honk your horn sir'. OK, but what has that got to do", "Keith McDonald was also placed on the sex offender's register for 10 years after being told he had \"abused his position as an employer\". At Selkirk Sheriff Court the 48-year-old was found guilty of committing the offences at the Ship Inn in Melrose. He was human resources manager at the pub where his wife was licensee. The court was told he repeatedly indecently assaulted one female employee between 2001 and 2011 by touching her breasts and buttocks which meant she tried to avoid contact with him. In 2007, McDonald indecently assaulted another female by touching her in a sexual nature. She immediately left her job. He was also found guilty of uttering sexual remarks to staff members over a 10-year period and on one occasion exposed himself in front of members of the public and two female members of staff.

The survey suggested that 44% of people in this age group never cycled and were therefore \"missing out on the benefits of cycling entirely\". However, Brake also found more people surveyed disagreed (59%) than agreed (41%) with the idea that current speed limits in their area are too fast for the safety of cyclists and pedestrians.

The 51-year-old pilot is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital. The report says the Hawker Hunter's canopy was released at the initial impact. At this time fuel and fuel vapour was released and then ignited. The jet split into four parts and both Mr Hill and his seat were thrown clear of the cockpit.

Black, 67, who controlled an empire including the Daily Telegraph in the UK, and US papers including the Chicago Sun-Times, left prison early on Friday. Earlier, Canada said he would be allowed to live there upon his release. Black was born in Canada but renounced his citizenship in 2001 to accept a peerage in Britain's House of Lords. He is a British citizen. The move to grant Black a one-year temporary residence permit stirred debate in Canada's House of Commons. Tom Mulcair, leader of the New Democratic Party, said Black had received special treatment. \"No-one else has ever been in that situation, of being still in jail, having his dossier marched around all the offices of the minister and getting his approval before even getting out of the slammer,\" Mr Mulcair said, according to CBC News.

Although they could not confirm the second murder, investigators said the teenager had claimed the woman \"put up more of a fight than the child\" and weighed some 120kg (19 stone). The motive for his attack appeared to have been the woman's bank, computer and phone details.

The case will go back to the organisation's appeal board on 24 May, when Best's conviction is likely to be overturned. However, the BHA insists it opposes other grounds for appeal and will effectively push for a retrial. \"Having received further details concerning the appeal, and having taken advice, we have decided not to contest the appeal on the grounds of apparent bias.

It also found schools had more influence than parents in giving confidence in understanding politics. Those aged 16 and 17 were able to vote in the referendum on 18 September, the first UK ballot to include them. Researchers at dpart gathered evidence from two surveys of under 18s - one conducted in April and May 2013, and then a second conducted one year later. More than 1,000 young people responded to each survey. They found under 18s were at least as interested in politics as adults. Only 7% had never talked about the referendum with anyone. Young people were less likely than adults to align themselves with political parties, but the proportion who said they did not feel an affinity to one dropped in the year before the vote, from 57% to 51%.

They were standing under another section of cliff that is showing signs of severe erosion. Ms Plass, a marine biologist, said the men were \"completely negligent\" and warned other walkers of the dangers. Ms Plass, who walks the cliffs regularly, said the section next to the coast path was slowly falling away. \"Every time I go there it seems the fissure has grown and the cliff has moved closer to falling to the beach,\" she said. \"It could go at any time because the hot weather will expand air pockets in the cliff and send it off.\" She spoke to one of the men taking pictures, but he said they were \"fine\", she said. \"It is not fine.

Bamber challenged a refusal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal as a miscarriage of justice. The CCRC, an independent body which investigates possible miscarriages, rejected Bamber's last appeal in April. The decision on Thursday follows a single judge rejecting Bamber's application for permission to seek judicial review of the CCRC's decision after he studied the case papers in private. Bamber made a renewed application dealt with by Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen's Bench Division, and Mr Justice Globe. Announcing the decision, Sir John said that having looked at the approach taken by the CCRC in the case he could not see \"any way\" in which a challenge could be made to the decision reached. \"It seems to me that a challenge is impossible to mount,\" he said.

Of the 11,000 officers who responded, only 6% believed there was \"adequate\" quantity of gun-carrying officers. The Met has said it would increase firearm officer numbers by 600. The threat level for international terrorism in the UK has been severe - meaning an attack is highly likely - since August 2014.

The cars drove nearly 636,000 miles last year, compared with just over 424,000 in 2015. Other states in the US do not require such reporting. The California Department of Motor Vehicles published the annual reports on Wednesday. Under law, every company that has a state permit to test autonomous vehicles in California must report how many times a driver had to intervene. \"Disengagements are a natural part of the testing process that allow our engineers to expand the software' s capabilities and identify areas of improvement,\" Waymo said in its report. The most common reasons for interventions in Waymo cars were \"software discrepancies, unwanted manoeuvres of the vehicle and perception discrepancies\", according to the company.

In a statement, the independent supporters group added: \"Many fans, including our members, decided to support the team, committed to season tickets, and bought merchandise under the impression that Frank Lampard would be playing for New York City Football Club, not Manchester City. \"Many of those fans are rightly outraged by this decision, and we support any course of action they take to voice their discontent over this decision.\" MLS franchise New York City are owned jointly by Manchester City and baseball giants the New York Yankees.

Mr Cade said the warbler could have been caught up in storms while crossing the Caribbean and blown across to Europe with \"a hell of a tailwind\". Another one has also been spotted on Mizen Head on the south west tip of Ireland in recent days. Mr Cade said the bird, about the size of a robin, was \"feeding well and appeared active\".

Sainsbury's said the market remained \"very competitive\" and the impact of cost pressures \"remains uncertain\". The supermarket's performance was worse than the 0.1% rise in like-for-like sales seen in the 15 weeks to 7 January.

The man can be seen picking up the food waste bin, checking it, then dumping the contents into the bin next to it. Waste company Serco has apologised for the \"completely unacceptable\" behaviour of one of its agency workers. Mr Gwyer was shocked and disappointed that his efforts to recycle at his home on Colombia Avenue appeared to be in vain. He told the BBC: \"It puts people off making the effort. You just think: what's the point? Life would be easier if we just put everything in one bin!\" However, he was adamant he held Serco responsible, not the worker. He said: \"I don't really want to single out any of the lads. It's a horrible job.\" But he added: \"They just seem to be rushing", "In the UK the products affected include funsize Mars and Milky Way bars and boxes of Celebrations. In the Netherlands Mars and Snickers bars were also affected. It comes after a customer in Germany found bits of plastic in a Snickers bar in January. The plastic was traced back to the Mars factory in the southern town of Veghel in the Netherlands. A Mars Netherlands spokesperson said: \"We cannot be sure that this plastic was only in that particular Snickers. We do not want any products on the market that may not meet our quality requirements, so we decided to take them all back.\" The recall only involved products manufactured at the Dutch plant. It covers mostly countries in Europe and does not extend to the US, where Mars is based.

Mr Cushnahan went on to work for Pimco when it mounted a formal bid. Mr Robinson told the finance committee it was for others to decide if Mr Cushnahan had a conflict of interest. He said he was \"not sure\" if there had been a conflict. The first minister also told the Stormont committee that he had been friendly with Mr Cushnahan for years and found him to be \"motivated by the best interests of Northern Ireland\". He added that Mr Cushnahan could be described as a \"pillar of the establishment\". He said that he or his special advisor had regular contact with Mr Cushnahan in the period leading up to the Nama deal.

He claimed he was taunted and spat at by staff from a competitor company. One of Donnelly's workers, James Moore, was also convicted of common assault. The victim, Kevin Boyle, claimed his nose was broken in the incident on 11 May last year. Donnelly, of St James' Park in the city, claimed he had been on the streets to try to stop aggravation between the rivals. He told Belfast Magistrates' Court that his firm had signed up to a code of conduct following meetings with City Centre Management and the Department of the Environment. According to Donnelly's account, Mr Boyle and a colleague approached him and started to taunt hum. \"They said 'Stick your code of conduct up your hole',\" the tour boss claimed.", "The statement contrasted with earlier signals from President Trump that he did not object to settlement activity. But it said he did not see settlements as an \"impediment to peace\" - a departure from previous US positions. The fate of settlements in the occupied West Bank is one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Israel's pro-settlement government, which had sharp differences with the Obama administration on the issue, felt emboldened when Donald Trump took office last month. Since then, it has authorised 6,000 new settlement homes,", "Jimmy Waters, who was on a delivery round, found the injured woman lying outside her home near West Linton. He is the second postman from Royal Mail's Peebles office to be recognised for his heroics. His colleague, Lawrence Fairbairn, was invited to the Queen's garden party after saving a woman who was trapped in her bath for three days. Mr Waters, 61, discovered the woman while he was delivering mail in a rural part of the Scottish Borders at 12:00 on 4 June. She had been trapped under her car since 10:00, when it had apparently suffered a problem with its handbrake and rolled backwards on top of her. The postman, who has 18 years experience, released the woman before raising the alarm, waiting with her until the ambulance arrived. His manager, Gary Watson, praised Mr Waters by saying: \"It could have been totally different had Jimmy not arrived when he arrived. \"The consequences of somebody", "The investigation found that only 28% of Welsh speakers had used the language with their GPs, dentists and opticians. Ms Huws said she hoped her report was the \"beginning of the end\" for patients being unable to have healthcare \"appropriate to their needs\". Welcoming the report, ministers said they would respond within six months. The inquiry, based on the experiences of more than a thousand Welsh speakers, found that 90% of them agreed that they should have the right to use the language when dealing with NHS wherever they live in Wales. Other findings included that: Welsh speakers who gave evidence to the inquiry reported feeling awkward and struggling to explain their feelings to an English speaking doctor.

After inspecting 18 schools, Ofsted said it had \"significant concerns\" about the company and its relationship with teachers and governors. The council said there had been issues with Entrust but it was improving. Entrust delivers much of the training and consultancy work in schools across the county. The staff transferred to the firm in 2013 included classroom support staff, school cooks, cleaners and caretakers. Ofsted carried out the inspections at 18 schools to see how effective Entrust was in supporting and raising classroom standards. It found six schools required improvement and three, which had previously been rated as good, needed to be placed in special measures. The remainder were rated as good. Ofsted regional director Lorna Fitzjohn said: \"There is considerable uncertainty among head teachers about how the local authority and Entrust work to improve", "The England midfielder, 24, made his debut from the bench in Saturday's 1-0 home win against West Bromwich Albion.

The Taxpayers Alliance looked at the pension schemes of all 101 local government pension schemes in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It said it obtained the information from local authorities' annual statements of accounts in 2010-11 and used actuarial estimates for assets held by councils and their liabilities to calculate their overall funding situation.

Gray suffered a severe spinal cord injury in police custody in April and died a week later.

The grand jury did not return charges on the false imprisonment charges that were brought against some of the officers. Ms Mosby brought the false imprisonment charges earlier claiming that Gray's arrest was unjustified and illegal. However, the grand jury did return new reckless endangerment charges that were not part of the original charges announced three weeks ago.

I don't know how I won the game,\" Selby said. \"I thought sooner or later I would come out and start performing, but it didn't seem to happen.\" Selby, famously described as a \"torturer\" by Ronnie O'Sullivan for his ability to grind out wins when not at his best, trailed 2-0, 3-2, 4-3 and 5-4, but showed all his renowned battling ability to pull through at the York Barbican. \"Jamie deserved to win the match,\" Selby admitted. \"He played great, scored two centuries and made more breaks.

It is believed that the men were involved in repeated attempts to infiltrate the Microsoft network between January and March this year. Both were charged under the UK's Computer Misuse Act that criminalises unauthorised access to computers. Police said the pair were part of a larger group that was plotting the cyber-intrusion into the software giant's systems, seeking to steal customer data. Detectives from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (Serocu) carried out the raids which, said Det Sgt Rob Bryant, also led it to seize devices believed to have been used in the attacks. He added that Serocu had worked with Europol, the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, the FBI and Microsoft to investigate the intrusions. \"After speaking with Microsoft, we can confirm they did not gain access to customer information,\" he said. \"It is too", "The firm said net profit came to 45.6m Australian dollars ($32.4m; \u00c2\u00a322.7m), an increase of 56.7% on the same period a year earlier.

Her report suggests that extending working lives would add \u00c2\u00a355bn a year to the UK economy. If everyone worked one year longer, it would add 1% to annual GDP, she says. \"Academic and historical evidence shows that, far from damaging job prospects, keeping more older people in work is associated with rising employment and wages for younger people,\" said Dr Altmann, a former adviser to 10 Downing Street. If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the \"lump of labour fallacy\" - the false belief that the number of jobs in an economy is fixed.

But members of the Welsh Assembly's Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee agreed the new legislation was needed to maintain Wales' \"social-partnership\" approach. In March, Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said it would be a \"democratic outrage\" if ministers in London tried to block the Welsh Trade Union Bill.

The species is rare in Britain, but \"quite well-known\" elsewhere in the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe and Canada, said Prof Horne. He was alerted to the possibility that the creatures were living in Loch Leven during a visit to the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne. Prof Horne had gone there to study a large archive of ostracods collected by a 19th Century naturalist, George Brady. The scientist said: \"I came across a microscope slide containing ostracods collected from Loch Leven in June 1890, among which were several specimens of Cytherissa lacustris. \"In some I could see", "Raslan Fadl was Egypt's first doctor to be convicted of performing FGM, even though the still widespread practice was officially banned in 2008.

Although this species was widespread at the time, scientists have largely had to rely on incomplete fossils. The analysis was carried out at the ESRF facility in Grenoble, France, and showed that the specimen was juvenile. The skeleton is too small and fragile, and the rocks around it too hard, to allow it to be studied by conventional means. In addition, the rock matrix in which the fossil is preserved contains trapped minerals which prevented it from being scanned in a standard CT scanner.

Carlisle MP John Stevenson said bus costs were not included in his expenses because activists on it had been campaigning in a national, not local, capacity. \"My election agent made a return of my election expenses as required by law,\" he said. \"The party's national bus tour was authorised and paid for by Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ), was intended to promote the party's success in the general election and did not form part of my local election expenses.\" A number of police forces are investigating whether some", "General Athanase Kararuza and his wife died instantly, while their daughter was injured.

A string of high-ranking army officials have been targeted during the conflict. Security forces have also been accused of killing opponents and dumping them in mass graves by rights group Amnesty International. Shortly after the attack in Bujumbura, the International Criminal court announced that it was starting a preliminary investigation into the violence in Burundi.

It said there had been a \"lack of proper engagement\" over the consultation and was considering launching a judicial review. The BBC has contacted the Airports Commission and is awaiting a response. The commission gave people three weeks to submit further evidence about air pollution on 8 May, but campaigners argue this was shorter than the consultation time usually recommended by the government. The Teddington Action Group also claims the period was insufficient for people to read the report's 200 pages of technical data.

TV presenter and adventurer Ben Fogle has backed the Blue Marine Foundation project and will help transfer the first 1,500 oysters. Olympic champion Sir Ben Ainslie has already supported the bid. Oyster fishing in the Solent was banned after the Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Project found the molluscs were failing to reproduce as a result of water quality, invasive species and over fishing. A pilot project, involving adult oysters, was previously held at Ainslie's racing team's base and at the University of Portsmouth's raft in Langstone Harbour. Following its success, Blue Marine Foundation said 10,000 juveniles would be transferred to cages at the two sites, as well as at four marinas across the Solent over the next month.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) panel also concluded that another insecticide, called DDT, was \"probably carcinogenic to humans\". And it classified a third insecticide called 2,4-D as possibly carcinogenic to humans.

This is because DDT and its breakdown products are highly persistent and can be found in the environment and in animals.

Seaman started grooming the girl when she was 10 and the sexual abuse began when she was 11, the court heard. Judge Graham Cottle, said: \"You did to her and made her do to you exactly what you pleased and demanded. Her young life must have been pure hell. \"You got away with this for years.

Gilligan's Island, which ran from 1964 to 1967, was about seven travellers marooned on a Pacific island. The Brady Bunch (1969 to 1974) was about a clean-cut, attractive family formed by the marriage of a widow and widower and their six children. Analysts say the shows were hit in part because they presented a wholesome image of America during a time of social upheaval. Both programmes have endured on countless television repeats, influencing generations of children in America and beyond who never saw them on the original run. Mr Schwartz conceived of the idea for The Brady Bunch in 1965 after reading that one-third of American households at the time included a child from a previous marriage. \"I realized there was a sociological change going on in this country, and it prompted me to sit down to write a script about it,\" Mr Schwartz", "They claim that under Barnett formula rules, Wales should get an extra \u00a31.67bn and Scotland \u00a32.9bn.

Ms Griffith is professor of economics at Manchester University. \"We currently try to tax corporate profits at the location where value is created, under international agreements formed in the 1980s. \"Implementation of this system is increasingly difficult in the presence of intangible and internationally mobile assets,\" she is expected to say. The fact that a company's assets often didn't have a physical presence - such as patents, trademarks and brands - made it difficult to calculate what a firm should pay and where, she believes. \"The most valuable ideas are often those that can be combined with other ideas to create even greater value. \"Tying the value created in this way to a physical location - and thus to a tax jurisdiction - can be very", "The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) is about to increase its involvement in the side, which has looked for new investors.

Its Labour Market Barometer stood at 59.1 in April, down from 60.6 in March. This was the lowest reading in 22 months and below the index for the UK as a whole. The barometer measures areas such as levels of staff demand, employment and wages to create a single-figure snapshot of labour market conditions. The figure is measured against a baseline of 50, with anything above representing an improvement and anything below a deterioration. Edinburgh recorded the strongest increase in permanent placements and Dundee the largest rise in temporary positions across the country. The most marked rise in demand for permanent and temporary staff was in the medical and care sector, followed by IT and computing.

Mr Khamenei accused the US of reneging on the West's nuclear deal with Iran and said trusting them was a \"mistake\". The \"Great Satan\" [US] and \"evil\" Britain were using \"pretexts\" like human rights abuses and terrorism to avoid fulfilling their commitments. Mr Khamenei was speaking at an event commemorating the death anniversary of the revolution's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. His comments come ahead of plans by the UN Security Council to discuss possible air drops of aid to Syrian areas under siege.

He described the situation as \"absolutely horrendous\". But he said the prime minister firstly had to permit entry to the UK for more migrants before they could be accepted by Northern Ireland. \"David Cameron is the person who can free up the devolved administrations who I think are willing to do more,\" Mr McGuinness said. \"I have no doubt the people of the north would gladly welcome any moves to allow more refugees to come here.\" Thousands of migrants have died this year trying to reach Europe by sea.

Education Minister Peter Weir said he had made it clear the education budget was \"under severe pressure\" and his priority was \"protecting school budgets\". \"The escalation of this action, resulting in strike days, will severely harm the education of the children that we all seek to serve,\" he added. \"It will cause major disruption to parents, and put further pressure on other teachers and leaders that are already struggling to cope in addition to damaging the reputation of teachers.\" Members of NASUWT are attending a rally in Belfast.

Scientists analysing data from Nasa's Mercury Messenger spacecraft now think this mystery darkening agent is carbon in the form of graphite. This graphite may be a relic of the planet's primordial crust, which was later covered up by volcanism. The findings are published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Patrick Peplowski from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Maryland and colleagues analysed measurements of the darkest parts of Mercury's surface taken by Messenger at the end of its mission. They found that the darkest \"stuff\" on Mercury had a carbon-rich composition and that it was associated with large impact craters. According to the team, this association is consistent with the dark material coming from deeper within the planet and being exposed when space rocks gouged it out. Like Earth's Moon and the other inner planets, Mercury likely had a global magma ocean when it was young and the surface was very hot. \"As this magma ocean cooled and", "The MPs, including former Conservative Attorney General Dominic Grieve, are concerned the report will not be published before May's election.

It took evidence from its last witness in 2011, but there have been prolonged discussions about which documents would be allowed into the public domain. In June last year, Sir John announced he was satisfied that the \"gist\" of talks between former Prime Minister Tony Blair and former US President George Bush could be made public, removing a major obstacle to publication of his report.

These deflected light patterns help electronics \"learn\" walking patterns and detect if they are deteriorating, for instance in the elderly. The carpet was demonstrated at the Photon12 conference in Durham, UK. The optical fibre network at the heart of the effort makes use of the same types of fibres that transmit data to homes and across oceans, in which light bounces along the fibres' length. To make them sensitive to the deflection caused by pressure, the researchers carved grooves in the fibres along their length so that the bouncing of the light was less efficient at the point where pressure was applied. Detectors at the carpet's edge convert the light into electrical signals which are then analysed by a computer. That analysis borrows heavily from technology developed at the university for use with medical scanners.
