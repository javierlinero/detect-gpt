Hello, let me begin this report by stating just how thankful I am to have been sent to Earth. It was truly an eye opening experience and without your guidance and funding would have been utterly impossible. Let me give you an overview of how Earth functions, and I think you will be surprised to find that it works very similar to our planet. There exists a large number of organisms going through one stage or another of change while they fall into their respective places on the planet. The conclusion of my research has confirmed what we have believed to be a universal law called net impact theory, which can be described in two parts: 1. a species can only exist if it has a net positive impact on its environment. 2. Species' which detract from their environment will go extinct. My research", "You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming. Accompanied by a strange man/woman, together you build a world you revisit every night. One day you see them at a coffee shop. You immediately recognize each other. You know that moment when you're lying awake at night, wondering if The Matrix was just the machines trolling us and this is all a simulation, plot holes and all. Sitting across from her I had one of those moments. Not one of our dreams. Our dreams had more lasers and robots and sometimes a t-rex. But still not real. \"You look like you do in the dream\" \"Did you expect me not to?\" \"I didn't think you were real\" I didn't think she was real either, but I felt like I shouldn't say that.

After a few moments you realize you are four years old again. I am jolted awake with a burst of pain in my right arm. The last thing I remember was walking home after last night. I had just left the bar, as I was celebrating my 21st birthday a week late with my friends, and I was crossing the street. I am in my old bedroom, so I must have gone to my mom's house, given that is is closer to the bar than my own house. I sit up in bed, and my room looks different. I look down at my arm, and it is in a cast. The last time I was in a cast was when I fell out of a tree on my fourth birthday. I look around my room.

I decided for the apocalypse that I would walk out into the street and just sit. Sit and wait for some heavy vehicle to rend my body asunder. It was all over. One by one they came, the others. From houses and stopped trucks they came and looked upwards. They sat with me, some gesture of solidarity perhaps. The lonely, the useless, the forgotten; together we sat on that fine July morning, breathing in the pitch of the road, our sweat, our fear, our hope.

It comes back later, but it completely vanishes when it rains. And it sets my nose on fire. My skin is sensitive to rain, I believe. It kinda itches and only a shower seems to provide some relief.

To my right 2.5 feet away is a third wall, this ones monotony is broken by a poster. Its colors seem to struggle with maintaining brightness as the life is sucked out of the them by the gray and grayblue surrounding it. Turning around, out the doorway is a hallway. Its an empty lifeless hallway. A first aid kit breaks the seemingly endless stream of ugly light brown. The light above me flickers.

The Atheist quipped \"Clearly I should be let in, the Satanist is the exact opposite of what you want in here.\" The Satanist glared at the Atheist, \"At least I knew of Gods existence and feared it. Even I admire some of his work!\". Saint Peter's smile widened slightly, then seeming to catch itself it shriveled back into a speaking shape. \"He brings up a good point Atheist, you don't even believe in God.\" He flipped some parchments over on his giant podium as if to add a period on his sentence.

The king of these lands spoke of the creature as if it were an army of heretics, invading the land to convert those that called it home and to gather riches. But the knight new better.

He saw in her what he never saw in his wife. Somewhere along the line his bride and he drifted apart, though they were never truly together. Their destiny together was a fabrication of nepotism and power. His parents found him a suitor and forced love into his world. For a long while he just accepted it.

There's no poverty, no one wants for anything, everyone knows their role and purpose. It is, essentially, perfect. But that perfection is accomplished via draconian law: the only punishment is the \"birth penalty\" Everything was perfect, no one had problems, everyone knew their place. Anyone who sinned was sent to Earth, given the birth \"penalty', and thus, utopia was established. For me, however, this was a dystopic society. No one strived for anything. People remained content with what they had. They settled for their roles, not trying to be the best anymore. Souls had given up all research, calling this the perfect society, the Stasis, heaven. It was hell. I was the only one born differently, with a thirst for perfection. I wanted to be the best, and so, the society sickened me.

The bianual event known as the great \"transition\" occurs every 2 years in November. The event is so regular the Americans even set their election cycle by it. The process is unique in the animal kingdom, especially amongst the more complex creatures. The transition from female to male is characterized by what is known as a \"mega-period\" where the uterus detaches from the internal vaginal tissue which is then pushed out and the membranes slough off over the course of 2 days. During this time the ovaries enter into and form pouches out of the labia majora which forms the individual's freshly formed testes. The reverse occurs with the male to female transition however it is generally much less painful as it is characterized by a disconcerting feeling of intense and rapid shrinkage and an unsettling \"click\" as the uterus reattaches to the end of the formerly present penis.

Thirty degrees had passed since I last checked and I was beginning to sense the repetition set in. I was surrounded by all this junk, these shards of metal and splinters of bone. Billions of years ago there were great lizards stalking the earth, they died out shortly after. In their remains we found bubbles, smaller than anyone could imagine, trapped beneath the sun bleached tomb. Afterwards there were creatures much like us, but different in a few ways. For one they must have had feathers like the great lizards, being the stepping stone between us and them. We discovered they were called *humans*. Regardless they also died out shortly after. We thought nothing of it, until I found more bubbles in their skeletons.

No screams, no fighting, absolutely nothing. It's almost boring. I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet.

My throat clenched, even the darkness isn't comforting, the water in my eyes making the ebony hard to focus on. I focus my sight, only seeing him again.

It was around lunch time so I stood in my kitchen making a couple of sandwiches. They were nothing special containing only, a bit of turkey, pepper jack cheese, and some mustard. \"Sandwich, sandwich, what's that? Sandwich!\" I sang while applying the mustard to my bread.

They would not have time to fully develop. He sat in an old lawn chair in the midst of his yard, the dirty red fabric frayed. The house behind him looked rickety at best. The window panes were gone, the paint was chipped, and the door was ajar. He stared into the sky, eyes focused on nothing. Before I could approach him, he called to me. \"I know what you're here for. I've known you'd come for me soon.\" He was interrupted here by his own hacking. Pulling a filthy handkerchief out of his equally filthy coat, he covered his mouth.

Every clock in the world had simultaneously changed its time by five minutes, depending on the owner's gender. Once this was figured out, most of the scheduling issues were swiftly resolved.

Snap. \"Now a picture of yourself.\" I turned the phone around and took a selfie with my breakfast, just as I had done at the golden gate bridge, the coast of Oregon, Yellowstone National Park, and every other stop that my mother and I had made. I noticed over the past few weeks that a haze had began to claim more and more of her memory, but every fight she had inside of her was arm wrestling Alzheimers.

Sadness is a feeling, an emotion; and those have long since abandoned me. I don't have a crush, I've always had one. The rejection hurt when my feelings weren't reciprocated, but this? This is so much worse. It doesn't hurt, there's just a hole. A whole where the pain should be, a space for me to store my sadness and my happiness, and let them fight to see who rules me today. But they've both left. I can *feel* where I should feel it, but it doesn't help. That hole is all there is now, by the time I even noticed it was there I had already been completely swallowed by it.

Happy 24th birthday to me! It took a while, but I was finally able to shrink myself to the size of an electron. I'm currently standing on the shrinking platform; the nucleus is way behind me and those little dots are the electrons zooming around. The atom I'm currently studying is an osmium nucleus. I'm not sure I explained to you before why I was so adamant about doing this. After my father died of prostate cancer two years ago I decided to devote my graduate research on finding new novel ways to help other people with similar afflictions. I found out through prior research that a couple of osmium compounds actually exhibited promising anti-cancer activity. The reason I chose osmium instead of other elements to check out was because it's much more abundant and potentially much cheaper to use if this blows up (hopefully because of", "You have a unique ability.

How do we feel when we see the horror of slavery? Our perspective is a tool for expressing how we feel about what we see. As we learn more about the world, we are able to gain perspective on it. Through these experiences, we are able to learn different ways of looking at things. The more we learn to see things from different points of view, the more perspective we gain. Thus, perspective is crucial to every level of learning.

But to describe how things should really perform without the aid of theory is a matter for mere speculators, who can only go by \"experience,\" and who cannot define things.

A young girl sat on a park bench on a brightly colored autumn day. Though her slightly hunched posture subtly indicated she was not quite as young as her appearance suggested, she had a quiet and unassuming air which lent a quiet air to her surroundings. This was a young woman living a peaceful life, and as such she was not the type of girl you'd expect to see wearing a Death Eater uniform at a public park.\n\nHer hands gripped the arm of a small child who had been playing outside on the hillside before her, and her lips curled into a wicked smile.\n\n\"Oh Death.

Memories are amazing. The ability to retain almost everything a person has felt in a certain point of time. This is where they can use these memories for their own benefit without the conscious mind having to work so hard to recreate them.

Obtain a magic staff from the temple's master. 2. Make and wear elemental staffs at the apprentice workshops. 3. Collect knowledge from NPCs through quests. 4. Learn spells from the Arcane University library. 5. Retest one additional task every week. Each temple is assigned in the order listed in the chart above. If a temple is not listed, an apprentice is not present at that temple, nor is there an apprenticeship plan in effect. This means that any high temple (in the order listed) will be automatically visited by all apprentice mages; however, if the city the temple is located in doesn't have a high temple, the high temple of the next city will", "Make me love the person you love When it comes to the steps you take in life - those moments when your feet feel worn and raw - he is all and more than you give him credit for.\n\nYour best friend in every phase of your life Your best friend in every phase of your life\n\nSocially aware, socially aware\n\nWe've spent the past 25 years working on projects that were all done in isolation so that we could see them from far afield, but that now we can sit and discuss each piece at all times.\n\nA real, live, human.\n\nCoffee's, sandwiches and conversations about everything - it's all there.\n\nHacking is part of our work life and work hours\n\nAs an IT guy, our main work is that we always have to be able to think quickly and work quickly.
