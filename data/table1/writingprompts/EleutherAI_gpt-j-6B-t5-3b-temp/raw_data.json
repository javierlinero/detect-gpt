Hello, let me begin this report by stating just how thankful I am to have been sent to Earth. It was truly an eye opening experience and without your guidance and funding would have been utterly impossible. Let me give you an overview of how Earth functions, and I think you will be surprised to find that it works very similar to our planet. There exists a large number of organisms going through one stage or another of change while they fall into their respective places on the planet. The conclusion of my research has confirmed what we have believed to be a universal law called net impact theory, which can be described in two parts: 1. a species can only exist if it has a net positive impact on its environment. 2. Species' which detract from their environment will go extinct. My research will hopefully continue to discredit the theory which this universal law replaced - survival of the fittest.", "You possess the ability of persistent lucid dreaming.

Anyone who sinned was sent to Earth, given the birth \"penalty', and thus, utopia was established. For me, however, this was a dystopic society. No one strived for anything. People remained content with what they had. They settled for their roles, not trying to be the best anymore. Souls had given up all research, calling this the perfect society, the Stasis, heaven.

The event is so regular the Americans even set their election cycle by it. The process is unique in the animal kingdom, especially amongst the more complex creatures. The transition from female to male is characterized by what is known as a \"mega-period\" where the uterus detaches from the internal vaginal tissue which is then pushed out and the membranes slough off over the course of 2 days. During this time the ovaries enter into and form pouches out of the labia majora which forms the individual's freshly formed testes. The reverse occurs with the male to female transition however it is generally much less painful as it is characterized by a disconcerting feeling of intense and rapid shrinkage and an unsettling \"click\" as the uterus reattaches to the end of the formerly present", "[ ip ] rusted jewelry hung at cemetery \"Is it a sata..satanic ritual to raise the dead?\" Tom questioned.

Thirty degrees had passed since I last checked and I was beginning to sense the repetition set in. I was surrounded by all this junk, these shards of metal and splinters of bone. Billions of years ago there were great lizards stalking the earth, they died out shortly after. In their remains we found bubbles, smaller than anyone could imagine, trapped beneath the sun bleached tomb. Afterwards there were creatures much like us, but different in a few ways. For one they must have had feathers like the great lizards, being the stepping stone between us and them. We discovered they were called *humans*. Regardless they also died out shortly after.

My throat clenched, even the darkness isn't comforting, the water in my eyes making the ebony hard to focus on. I focus my sight, only seeing him again. I hold my breath, remembering his warm touch, feeling it again, my body breathing an automatic reply as I hold my own airways closed.

Every clock in the world had simultaneously changed its time by five minutes, depending on the owner's gender. Once this was figured out, most of the scheduling issues were swiftly resolved. Men set their clocks back five minutes, women forward five minutes. Confusion at how it had happened still abounded, but for the most part everything was back to normal. So the world thought.

August 21, 2801 Today, we were finally given some history on our markings. They were called tattoos in The Before- initially considered taboo, then art, then the norm. People chose them, designed them, and blazed them into their skin with needles. A choice. This concept is foreign in The After. When Jesus returned to us from Heaven (once known as Gliese 581g), everything changed. The marking of one's skin angered the Lord- he forbade it in The Book and his colonization disregarded the warning. It was the last straw in a wave of separation from the life dictated in The Book.

After my father died of prostate cancer two years ago I decided to devote my graduate research on finding new novel ways to help other people with similar afflictions. I found out through prior research that a couple of osmium compounds actually exhibited promising anti-cancer activity. The reason I chose osmium instead of other elements to check out was because it's much more abundant and potentially much cheaper", "You have a unique ability.
